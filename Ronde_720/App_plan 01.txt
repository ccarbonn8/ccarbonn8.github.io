AppName : RES_TA (Résultats de tir à l'arc)
----------------------------------------------
Description: 
- This app is used to enter arrow points during a round at a given target.
- We expect one archer per target will use the app while the others write results on paper cards.
Database: localstorage during the competition, and COMP_TA_DB (Firestore) to load and save final results.
Use:
- Archers are expected to scan a QR code with their phone to launch the app on the correct round. 
  - This should take them directly to the round planned by the organizers.
  - They should then specify the target number and archer info should appear. 
  - They can modify this info by selecting from list of registered archers in the round (from COMP_TA_DB).
- The app will watch for duplicate entry on the same archer as there is only one line per archer per end.
- Archers can use the app without the QR code but then the results are only saved locally.
  - They have to select the type of round and the archers.
  - A warning message will tell them they are only local to their device.
